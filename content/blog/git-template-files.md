# Standardizing Git Workflow: Commit Templates, PR Templates, and More

In Git, there are several templates available that can greatly improve your development workflow. Let's explore some of these templates and understand how they can save time and enhance collaboration.

## Commit Templates: Structured Commit Messages

A commit template is a file that provides a predefined structure for your commit messages. By using commit templates, you can ensure consistent formatting and information in each commit message. This helps in better understanding the changes made and improves project maintainability. 

Examples where commit templates save time include:

1. **Feature Development**: When working on a feature, using a commit template allows you to provide clear and concise information about the purpose of the commit, the changes made, and any related references. This makes it easier for other developers to review and understand your commits.

2. **Bug Fixes**: When fixing a bug, a commit template can prompt you to include details about the bug, steps to reproduce it, and the solution applied. This comprehensive information helps in tracking down the bug's source and verifying the fix.

example git commit template: (.git/.commit-msg-template)
```
[Feature] Add user authentication

- Integrated authentication middleware for protecting sensitive routes.

```


## PR Templates: Clear Pull Request Descriptions

PR templates provide a predefined structure for pull request descriptions. When creating a pull request, using a PR template ensures that you include essential information, such as a summary of the changes, the problem being addressed, the proposed solution, and any relevant context or documentation.

Examples where PR templates save time include:

1. **Code Reviews**: A well-structured PR template assists reviewers by providing all the necessary information about the changes made. Reviewers can quickly understand the purpose of the PR, review the diff, and provide valuable feedback without spending extra time gathering information.

2. **Change Management**: In projects with multiple stakeholders, PR templates help in efficient change management. By including details about the purpose, impact, and risks associated with the changes, stakeholders can make informed decisions and give appropriate approvals.

example PR template file: (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
```
## Summary
Provide a brief overview of the changes made in this pull request.

## Problem
Describe the issue or problem this PR aims to solve.

## Solution
Explain the approach taken to address the problem.

## Changes Made
List the specific changes made in this PR.

## Related Documentation
Include links or references to any relevant documentation.

## Checklist
- [ ] Code has been reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests have been added/updated
- [ ] Documentation has been updated

```


## Issue Templates: Structured Issue Reporting

Issue templates define a predefined structure for creating new issues in your project's issue tracker. By providing specific sections, such as problem description, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior, issue templates help in capturing detailed and structured information when reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements.

Examples where issue templates save time include:

1. **Bug Reporting**: By using an issue template, users can provide all the necessary information to reproduce a bug, including specific steps, environment details, and relevant logs. This reduces back-and-forth communication and allows developers to start investigating the issue promptly.

2. **Feature Requests**: Issue templates can guide users to provide comprehensive details about their feature requests, such as use cases, expected behavior, and any related dependencies. This helps in better understanding the requirements and facilitates smoother implementation.

Example issue template (issue_template.md):
```
## Description
Provide a clear and concise description of the issue.

## Steps to Reproduce
Outline the steps to reproduce the issue, including any specific inputs or conditions.

1. 
2. 
3. 

## Expected Behavior
Describe what you expected to happen.

## Actual Behavior
Explain what actually happened.

## Additional Information
Include any additional information or context that may be relevant.
```
## Release Templates: Consistent Release Documentation

Release templates define the structure and content of release notes or release documentation. By using release templates, you can include relevant information, such as feature highlights, bug fixes, and breaking changes, in a standardized format.

Examples where release templates save time include:

1. **Release Notes**: With a release template, you can consistently document the changes made in each release, making it easier for users and stakeholders to understand the updates and enhancements introduced.

Example release template (release_template.md):
```
## Version X.Y.Z

### Features
- List notable features or enhancements added in this release.

### Bug Fixes
- Summarize the bug fixes or issues resolved in this release.

### Breaking Changes
- Identify any breaking changes or backward-incompatible modifications made.

### Known Issues
- Highlight any known issues or limitations in this release.

### Documentation Updates
- Mention any updates made to the project's documentation.

### Contributors
- Recognize the contributors who made significant contributions to this release.
```


By utilizing these templates, you can improve your Git workflow, promote consistency, and enhance collaboration within your development team. Whether it's structured commit messages, clear pull request descriptions, well-defined issue reporting, or consistent release documentation, these templates provide a framework for efficient and effective collaboration.

Remember to customize the templates according to your project's specific needs and conventions
