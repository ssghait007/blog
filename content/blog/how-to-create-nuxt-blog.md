# Build a blog using Nuxt and Tailwind CSS

In this post I will walk you through how I created this blog

## Frameworks used

- Nuxt
- Tailwind CSS
- Tailblocks

### What is Nuxt ?

Nuxt.js is a free and open source web application framework based on Vue.js, Node.js, Webpack and Babel.js.
You can also create Static sites and server side rendered webapp with nuxt.
It abstracts most of the complex configuration involved in managing things like asynchronous data, middleware, and routing.

## Create nuxt app

Create nuxt app using below command

```bash{1,3-5}
yarn create nuxt-app <project-name>
```

You can choose to add nuxt content module while project create.
Or you can add it manually https://content.nuxtjs.org/installation

```bash{1,3-5}
yarn add @nuxt/content
```

## Adding ready to use CSS blocks from Tailblocks

Navigate to https://tailblocks.cc/
Choose any header footer and content blocks you like.
Add these blocks to nuxt `layouts/default.vue` file

    <div>
        <Header></Header>
        <Nuxt/>
        <Footer></Footer>
    </div>

`<Nuxt/>` will render pages as per routes.
Add `pages/index.vue` and `pages/blog/index.vue` they will serve on `/` and `/blog` route.
Put homepage content in `pages/index.vue` and blog layout in `pages/blog/index.vue`

## Writing Content

create a `content/` directory in your project:

```
content/
  blogs/
    article-1.md
    article-2.md
  home.md
```

In Each `article.md` file you can add your content as below

## Display Blogs data

You need to fetch all posts as below and display in your vue template

```js{1,3-5}
async  asyncData({ $content }) {
	const  posts  =  await  $content('blog').fetch()
	return {
		posts,
	}
},
```

`posts` variable will have all posts from that folder, you can loop over and display them in any format. There are various ready to use blocks here https://tailblocks.cc/

Further you can create a `pages/blog/_slug.vue` this will show content for route `/blog/article-1`.
You need to fetch individual post as below and display in your vue template

```js{1,3-5}
async  asyncData({ $content, params }) {
	const  post  =  await  $content('blog', params.slug).fetch()
	return { post }
},
```

## Create a static build

After you have created the blog setup, static build can be generated by using below command

```bash{1,3-5}
nuxt generate //or
npm run generate
```

## Bonus: Hosting on netlify

You can easily host project from github on netlify.

- Go to [www.netlify.com](http://www.netlify.com/) and login or signup.
- Select “New site from git”.
- Choose your provider (e.g. GitHub) — You may need to authenticate here.
- Select the git repository you want to create a site from.
- Select the branch you want to deploy from.
- Choose any commands that need to be run. — _in our case its `npm run generate`_
- Choose the directory that you will publish from. It will contain files such as index.html. — _in our case its `dist`._
- Select “Build Site”.
