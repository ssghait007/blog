# About Jane Doe

I'm a Frontend Developer passionate about creating exceptional user experiences through clean, accessible, and performant web applications. With over 5 years of experience in the industry, I've worked with startups and established companies to bring digital products to life.

## My Expertise

I specialize in modern frontend development with a focus on:

- **React & Vue.js**: Building scalable component-based applications
- **CSS & Design Systems**: Creating consistent, maintainable styling solutions
- **Web Accessibility**: Ensuring applications work for everyone
- **Performance**: Optimizing for speed and user experience
- **TypeScript**: Writing type-safe, maintainable code

## Philosophy

I believe that great frontend development is about more than just making things look good. It's about creating inclusive, fast, and intuitive experiences that users love. Every line of code should serve a purpose and contribute to the overall user experience.

## When I'm Not Coding

When I'm not building web applications, you can find me:
- Contributing to open source projects
- Writing about frontend development
- Mentoring junior developers
- Exploring new design trends and technologies
