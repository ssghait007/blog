          A privacy policy (also referred to as a privacy notice) is a statement
          or legal document that describes how a company, website, or app
          collects, uses, maintains, and shares data collected from or about its
          users. Most countries require any website that collects personal
          information from its users to have a written privacy policy posted on
          the website.
